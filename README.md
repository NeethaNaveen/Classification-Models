# Classification-Models
It is Jupyter Notebook file to expaining and evaluating various classification models used in supervised machine learning. Dataset: Use the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.

Classification Algorithm Implementation:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Model Evaluation and Comparison:
accuracy_score,precision_score,recall_score,f1_score
